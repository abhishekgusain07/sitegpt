        <div>
          <p>GPT-4 messages are 10 times costlier than GPT-3.5 messages.</p>

            For example, let's take <strong>$99/mo Growth plan</strong>.<br />
            In this plan, you get <strong>10k messages per month</strong> if you use <strong>GPT-3.5</strong>.<br />
            But if you use <strong>GPT-4</strong>, then you only get <strong>1k messages per month</strong>.<br />
            You can also use a combination of both <strong>GPT-3.5</strong> and <strong>GPT-4</strong> if you want.
